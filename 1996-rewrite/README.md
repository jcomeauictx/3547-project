# Followup in 1996

I don't remember much about this, but I was given time, on the clock, to
rewrite the software to use PostScript instead of PCL5. I wasn't quite up
to the job, however, and eventually, after no results, it was called off.

As I recall, I was unable to wrap my head around stream processing. It still
gives me headaches to this day, but over the years I've had some success
with it.
